# Openlayer templates 

To accelerate the setup with Openlayer, you can use templates. Templates are sample projects that use common AI patterns and tools, and that already contain the configurations required by Openlayer.
They show how Openlayer's **development** and **monitoring** modes can be added to your project.

You can pattern-match based on the programming language, the framework, the AI/ML task type, or the use case.

## What is Openlayer?

Openlayer is an evaluation tool that fits into your **development** and **production** pipelines to help you ship high-quality models with confidence.
